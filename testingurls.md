Here are the live website URLs of Hedera DeFi projects you can test with your trust audit tool:

Status: Active, #1 DEX on Hedera

2. Hashport (Cross-chain Bridge)

4. HeliSwap
URL: https://www.heliswap.io​

App: https://app.heliswap.io​

Status: ⚠️ Terminated operations​

(You can still test this to see if your tool detects the shutdown as a trust issue)

Test Strategy:
Start with SaucerSwap (most active) and Hashport (complex bridge protocol) - these are good candidates to see if your tool can detect any trust/security issues in live DeFi protocols. The terminated HeliSwap could be interesting to test if your tool flags shut-down projects as red flags.
